c*****in order to get landscape-mode plots, "sm" must be given the 
c     appropriate flag in its call (look at the end of lineplot.f).  
c     This is machine-dependent, so here one specifies the machine.
c     "mac" = Intel-based Apple Mac
c     "pcr" = a PC or desktop running Redhat linux
c     "pcl" = a PC running another form of linux
c     "uni" = a machine running Unix, specifically Sun Solaris
      machine = "pcr"
